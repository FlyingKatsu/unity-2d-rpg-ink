Reusable code for powering INK stories with Unity as a 2D RPG engine

This repo contains Unity scripts and documentation regarding their intended usage. It may also contain documentation about [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), which some of these scripts are meant to integrate with.

This repo will not contain a playable game, but it may contain sample Unity scenes and prefabs using free art assets for demonstration purposes.
